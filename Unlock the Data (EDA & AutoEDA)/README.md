**📊 Exploratory Data Analysis:**

The main goal of EDA is to gain an understanding of the data and identify any patterns, relationships, or anomalies that may be present. EDA is often used as a first step in data analysis before more advanced techniques are applied, such as machine learning or predictive modeling.

* Analysts use various techniques and tools such as summary statistics, visualizations, and hypothesis testing to gain insights and understand the hidden information from data.
* EDA requires a high level of skill and expertise to perform effectively.
* Process can be time consuming.

**Automated Exploratory Data Analysis:**

* AutoEDA is an automated approach to analyzing datasets.
* Uses machine learning algorithms to automatically detect patterns, relationships, and trends in the data.
* AutoEDA requires minimal human intervention and save a time as compare to normal eda.
* AutoEDA is less flexible than manual EDA, as it is limited to the algorithms and techniques.
* AutoEDA is a good option for analysts with limited expertise or for preliminary analysis.

**📈 Pros and Cons of using AutoEDA:**

**Pros:**

* AutoEDA can perform various data analysis tasks much faster than humans, reducing the time required to clean, process and analyze data.

* AutoEDA automates several time-consuming and repetitive tasks.

* AutoEDA tools can be accessed easily and used by non-technical users as well.

* AutoEDA can handle large and complex datasets.

**Cons:**

* AutoEDA algorithms lack the domain expertise required to identify relevant variables, interpret results accurately.

* Designed to perform predefined data analysis tasks and may not be customizable.

* Over reliance on AutoEDA can lead to a lack of critical thinking and the inability to identify errors or biases.

* May not always detect or correct data quality issues, such as missing or incorrect data.
