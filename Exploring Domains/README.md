**Introduction to Machine Learning üß†**

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Machine Learning is the training of a model from data that generalizes a decision against a performance measure.

**Difference between ML vs AI ü§ñ**

AI involves creating systems that can reason, understand natural language, perceive their environment, and make decisions, while ML is concerned with building systems that can recognize patterns and make predictions based on data.

AI often requires large amounts of data to train the system, while ML can be effective with smaller datasets. However, ML can be limited by the quality and relevance of the data used for training.

Examples of AI include Siri, Alexa, self-driving cars, and chess-playing computers, while examples of ML include image recognition, spam detection, and recommendation systems.

**Do's while working on Deep Learning ‚úîÔ∏è:**

* Do have a clear understanding of the problem you are trying to solve before starting with any ML/DL model development.
* Do invest more time in data preprocessing and cleaning to ensure high quality data.
* Do select the right algorithm that is best suited for the problem you are trying to solve.
* Do experiment with different models and parameters to find the best one for the specific use case.
* Do visualize your data and model outputs to gain insights
* Do document your work, including the problem statement, data sources, methodology, and results.

**Dont's while working on Deep Learning ‚ùå:**

* Don't assume that more data always leads to better performance. Quality of data is more important than quantity.
* Don't overfit your model to the training data. Always validate your model on test or validation data to ensure it generalizes well.
* Always experiment with different hyperparameters to find the best combination for your specific use case.
* Don't ignore feature selection and engineering, as it can significantly impact model performance.
* Don't forget to handle missing or imbalanced data, as it can cause bias and inaccuracies in your model.
